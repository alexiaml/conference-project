		  <h2>Creating An Inclusive Experience</h2>
            
        <p>The web should be for everyone who has access to it. It makes sense, doesn't it? The problem is that most web developers tend not to think in terms of accessibility, or even efficient usability for that matter. We must stop designing for only 85% of users and consider how to make designs work for all. Accessible and usable design does not necessarily mean that aesthetic and streamlined methods must be sacraficed. This is just an important skill and mode of thought to incorporate if not done so already. </p>

		  <blockquote>Accessible design is good design.</blockquote>
            
            <p>This conference seeks to bring creators together in order to facilitate discussions and workshops that will allow guests to learn more about what accessible design is and how it is used. We hope that the chosen speakers for this year will be able to inspire and aid guests in thinking more inclusively.</p>
